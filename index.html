<h1>A Serious Threat</h1>
<p>Ransomware is a type of malware that takes devices hostage and encrypts their files. A threat actor then demands money for the decryption of these files, which is where the 'ransom' part comes from-- they're holding your files for ransom! You can get ransomware from clicking suspicious links in web pages, or opening suspicious emails. Over the years they have been very profitable for threat actors and therefore are constantly changing and improving to circumvent countermeasures.
